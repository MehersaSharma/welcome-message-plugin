## ✨ About Me & Application to Automattic – Systems Engineer Role

Hi Automattic team! 👋  
Thanks for checking out my GitHub. I'm Mehersa Sharma, and I'm applying for the Systems Engineer position on the WordPress VIP team.

Since the application form didn’t have fields for these, I’ve included my answers here.

### 🌐 What do the dots on the Automattic Data Center map represent?

The dots likely represent **edge locations and data centers** used for CDN distribution, load balancing, and regional redundancy. I cross-referenced these dots with known AWS/GCP/Cloudflare locations and compared latency reports with Automattic product reach. Different colors may represent **primary vs. secondary infrastructure or content-specific routing (e.g., Jetpack, WordPress.com, VIP clients)**.

### 🏗️ Largest Infrastructure I’ve Managed

In my current role at Keysight, I worked on enterprise-scale ERP tools and automation dashboards used by multiple internal teams globally. While not public-facing, the impact was broad—serving over 2,000+ internal users daily with uptime requirements >99%. I was responsible for both backend logic and automated testing.

### ☸️ Kubernetes Experience

While I haven’t deployed full production-grade K8s clusters yet, I’ve worked on containerizing internal AI/ML tools using Docker and deploying them via orchestration tools for dev and QA teams. I’m actively learning cluster management and fault-tolerant design using K3s and GKE in my side projects.

### 📈 Product Scale & Server Management

The ML-based Email Threat Detection project I built handled simulated inbox loads from 500+ unique mail flows, and I tested it across 5 parallel servers during the peak dev phase. My exposure to infra-level configs has grown since, and I’m eager to deepen this knowledge in a production-grade setting.

### 🌐 Nginx / Lua / OpenResty

I’ve configured Nginx for WordPress deployments (including this plugin), worked with reverse proxies for internal apps, and optimized headers for caching. I’ve only explored Lua and OpenResty conceptually but would love to dive deeper as part of Automattic's stack.

📬 Thanks again for reading — I really hope to bring my curiosity and eagerness to Automattic!
